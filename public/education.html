      Not sure how to save money?  Well, you're not alone!  According to one study,
      87% of teenagers said they didn't know much about saving,
      but at least 35% wanted to know.
      The good news is all it takes is learning some skills and practicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The experts say that also having good financial role models is a good generally good practice.
      Don't be afraid to ask for advice about this.  We all have to start somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      And speaking of starting somewhere, that's where divvy comes in.
      Are you saving up for a car, a phone, a prom dress?  Just tell divvy what your goal is and,
      then you'll know how much to put aside every day. (You might want to put it in an envelope or somewhere
      you don't have to see it all the time.  According to experts, your willpower is more likely to stay strong,
      if you don't have what you are trying to avoid in your line of sight.)

    <p>
      So go ahead and set your goal, and get divvying!  You'll be making your dreams come true in no time!
